This project is a copy from the book 'Automate the boring stuff with python'.
I am implementing this to gain experience with File I/O in python as well as getting accustomed to git and GitHub commands.

Description of Project: Multiclipboard- 
The program will save each piece of clipboard text under a keyword. For example, when
you run  py mcb.pyw save spam , the current contents of the clipboard will be saved with
the keyword spam. This text can later be loaded to the clipboard again by running  py
mcb.pyw spam . And if the user forgets what keywords they have, they can run  py mcb.pyw
list  to copy a list of all keywords to the clipboard.
